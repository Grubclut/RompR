# How To Install Romp–Ø on Android

I've not tried this myself but there are reports that Rompr will run on an Android device if you install a Linux distro (eg Ubutnu) using [Linux Deploy](https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy) and then follow the standard [Linux install instructions](/RompR/Recommended-Installation-on-Linux).

You need to make one slight tweak to the setup:

    sudo addgroup www-data aid_inet

You should note that Rompr requires a fair amount of storage space for its cache, so you should install or symlink it as appropriate to wherever on your device has the most available storage.

Decent way to make use of an old phone.
